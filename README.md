=======================
This is our playbook. It is the foundation that allows us to architect & design systems that move our client projects forward.  In it, you will find practical approaches for building frontend & backend javascript applications.

This is a living document, and we intend to share our knowledge as we continue to work towards making the web a better place. Please read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting a pull request.
